# Overview
From destroying families for lack of a pronoun to the destruction of Canadian truck-drivers for a right to protest, can anyone yet doubt that we've seen the ugliest side of pop culture?

Not since the rise of Nazi Germany, the CCP, China bordering Koreas & Vietnams, the former Soviet Union - or other socialist '[Utopias](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMLBN65W)' - has our planet witnessed so much media and state-hate, friends!

Most of us abandoning the social medias the moment our own governments decided to turn freedom's posts against anyone ... but who‚Äôs community were those friends, anyway?

## Speak-Easy
Thus the mission of this **Nexus 9000 Project** is to boldly allow 'wee content creators to move our communities away from all **astoundingly** untrustworthy content-aggregators. *-- Let alone to protect our friends against so many bovine, would-be woes and foes.* (I mean this all *nicely*, of course!)

Indeed, optionally protecting our 'stuff from marauding 'haters is a decent bonus of RssIO; I've herein cobbled together a very customizable 'special sauce' designed to help us create and share our own speech-sharing strategies.

## A Nexus Registry
The `FileRegistry.py` demonstrates an easy way to register your RSS Site(s.) Run the .register() of the Registry class then merge your
URLs to the registry.txt file in this Project. See the test case for more information?

**Note:** THE RssIO PROJECT IS INTENDED FOR USE WITH PUBLIC SECURITY PROTOCOLS. BE SURE TO UNDERSTAND THE RISK OF PRIVATELY PROTECTING YOUR CONTENT FROM GOVERNMENTAL EYES. DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT WILL LAND YOU IN PRISON.

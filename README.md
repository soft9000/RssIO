# Overview
From destroying families for lack of a pronoun to the destruction of Canadian truck-driver for a right to protest, can anyone yet doubt that we've seen the ugliest side of pop culture?

Most of us abandoning the social medias the moment our own governments decided to turn our very own posts against us… but who’s community were our friends, anyway?

So this project is a way to share, serve, and protect our content. RssNexus is the easiest path for the 'share' and the 'serve.'

Protecting our 'stuff from marauding 'haters is where we've cobbled together a very simple special sauce. The NexusProject Module is  all about that.

# Operations

Three different workflows here:

First - and as expected - we simply need to create + manage a default RssProject.

Secondly - and a tad more complex - we need to update an existing RSS site. 
For reasons of simplicity we're assuming we've created it. 

Thirdly - We'll need to download, decode, and browse out content-secured 'stuff.


# RssIO
A Pythonic way to read, write, and manage as many Really Simply Syndications as possible.

# RssNexus
A faster / less error prone way to  skin & RSS our content. Perfect for static websites.

The idea is simple: We'll add any type of file into an input folder, define as many skins in the template folder as we require, then use RSSNexus to burn the final content to the output folder.

Once burned to the output folder the RSS file therein will link to the same.

# NexusProject
RssSite is presently a work in progress. Everything else is o.k for you to use in your own.

RssSite is much like RssNexus, but RssSite adds an official set of hard-wired assumptions.

An RssSite is designed to read any single `input` folder, skin the text using any input-defined 
`template` file, then place the results into a single `output` folder. 
    
Ready to upload to your site, the `output` folder will also contain the `nexus.rss` file.

A default template is provided. Feel free to change it and / or create your own template file(s) 
to use from within your `input` file updates.

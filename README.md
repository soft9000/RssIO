# Overview
From destroying families for lack of a pronoun to the destruction of Canadian truck-drivers for a right to protest, can anyone yet doubt that we've seen the ugliest side of pop culture?

Not since the rise of Nazi Germany, the CCP, China bordering Koreas & Vietnams, the former Soviet Union - or other socialist '[Utopias](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMLBN65W)' - has our planet witnessed so much media and state-hate, friends!

Most of us abandoning the social medias the moment our own governments decided to turn our very own posts against us… but who’s community were our friends, anyway?

So this project is a way to share, serve, and protect our content. Of the modules herein, the RssNexus Module is the easiest path for the 'share' and the 'serve.'

Protecting our 'stuff from marauding 'haters is where we've cobbled together a very customizable special sauce. The NexusProject Module is all about sharing our content with our friends, not our woes!

# Operations
Three different workflows here:

First - and as expected - we simply need to create + manage a default RssProject.

Secondly - and a tad more complex - we need to update an existing RSS site. 
For reasons of simplicity we're assuming we've created it. 

Thirdly - We'll need to download, decode, and browse out content-secured 'stuff.


# A RssIO Module
A Pythonic way to read, write, and manage as many Really Simply Syndications as possible.

# A SecIO Module
Pluggable security protocols. Horrifically updatable.

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS INTENDED FOR USE WITH PUBLIC SECURITY PROTOCOLS. BE SURE TO UNDERSTAND THE RISK OF 
PRIVATELY PROTECTING YOUR CONTENT FROM GOVERNMENTAL EYES. DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT WILL LAND YOU IN PRISON.

# A RssNexus Module
A faster / less error prone way to  skin & RSS our content. Perfect for static websites.

The idea is simple: We'll add any type of file into an input folder, define as many skins in the template folder as we require, then use RSSNexus to burn the final content to the output folder.

Once burned to the output folder the RSS file therein will link to the same.

# The Nexus Module
RssSite is presently a work in progress. Everything else is o.k for you to use in your own.

RssSite is much like RssNexus, but RssSite adds an official set of hard-wired assumptions.

An RssSite is designed to read any single `input` folder, skin the text using any input-defined 
`template` file, then place the results into a single `output` folder. 
    
Ready to upload to your site, the `output` folder will also contain the `nexus.rss` file.

A default template is provided. Feel free to change it and / or create your own template file(s) 
to use from within your `input` file updates.
